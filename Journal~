I installed Android studio. I referenced this good tutorial: http://www.androidauthority.com/first-android-app-what-you-need-to-know-619260/
However, in my Ubuntu, I got an error from android studio saying that SDK or libraries could not be installed. 
Then this was the solution: http://stackoverflow.com/questions/28804863/android-studio-how-to-install-android-platform-tools-on-ubuntu-14-04-64-bit
It was because Android needs 32 bit libs and I have a 64 bit Ubuntu.
Here are some tips I found to make the emulator fast:

Today I am back to my biometrics research work. I was away coz I worked on the SACMAT paper, was sick and was catching up with Programming
Languages course.
- I got an idea yesterday that I could use the same method of obtaining a circuit from IDP for authentication verification later. But the circuits can be used only once, which is a problem.
- Good question I can ask in the summer school: are garbled circuits re-usable?

Back to android development:
----------------------------
-emulator runs Android in a kind of virtual machine, as an Android phone with an Intel processor. 
This is faster than emulating an ARM processor on your PC.

Some background search:
-----------------------
Today, I was just searching zero knowledge biometrics authentication for remote services. I got a bunch of results - papers and a commercial
product. This commercial product : sedicii (https://www.sedicii.com), seem to be doing exactly what I have done: ZKP based identity verification/authorization.
They say that they do credit card authorization as well as biometrics authorization in ZKP - exactly my two works.

Their credit card authorization: https://www.sedicii.com/portfolio_page/credit-card-authorisation/ and https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f98sx0REg8w

- it works differently than ours. When you want to pay using credit card, you send a request to sedicii service, giving your public identifier. Sedicii does ZKP authentication and if successful, sends two tokens to merchant and client, if the two tokens match, 
merchant accepts the transaction. 
- It is used for website login (such as bank).

I think it has issues: everything goes through sedicii. It is like central point of failure, and of trust. It seems like all user identity 
need to be managed at sedicii. In our case, it is not like that. We do not come in the middle. You can use your existing IDPs to issue tokens and you will be performing ZKP with the merchant itself.

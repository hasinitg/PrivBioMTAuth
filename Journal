I installed Android studio. I referenced this good tutorial: http://www.androidauthority.com/first-android-app-what-you-need-to-know-619260/
However, in my Ubuntu, I got an error from android studio saying that SDK or libraries could not be installed. 
Then this was the solution: http://stackoverflow.com/questions/28804863/android-studio-how-to-install-android-platform-tools-on-ubuntu-14-04-64-bit
It was because Android needs 32 bit libs and I have a 64 bit Ubuntu.
Here are some tips I found to make the emulator fast:

Today I am back to my biometrics research work. I was away coz I worked on the SACMAT paper, was sick and was catching up with Programming
Languages course.
- I got an idea yesterday that I could use the same method of obtaining a circuit from IDP for authentication verification later. But the circuits can be used only once, which is a problem.
- Good question I can ask in the summer school: are garbled circuits re-usable?

Back to android development:
----------------------------
-emulator runs Android in a kind of virtual machine, as an Android phone with an Intel processor. 
This is faster than emulating an ARM processor on your PC.

Some background search:
-----------------------
Today, I was just searching zero knowledge biometrics authentication for remote services. I got a bunch of results - papers and a commercial
product. This commercial product : sedicii (https://www.sedicii.com), seem to be doing exactly what I have done: ZKP based identity verification/authorization.
They say that they do credit card authorization as well as biometrics authorization in ZKP - exactly my two works.
They have not described how they do biometrics authentication in ZKP, however, it should be similar to their website loging scenario:
I have written how their credit card authorization is comparable to ours in my RahasNym journal.

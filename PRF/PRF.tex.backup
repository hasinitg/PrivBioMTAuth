Privacy Preserving Biometrics based Remote Authentication Protocol for Mobile Devices}

\begin{document}
\maketitle
\section{Motivation:}
There has been a major shift from traditional authentication mechanisms such as passwords to biometrics based authentication in the recent past as 
the leaders in banking (such as Citi, HSBC, Barclays, USAA etc), credit cards (such as Master card) and e-commerce (such as Amazon and Alibaba) are 
adopting biometrics to authenticate users to their applications.

While biometrics has been treated as a strong factor of authentication for its ability to uniquely identity an individual, different vendors have 
adopted it for different motivations, for examples, Amazon is going to use selfies to authenticate transactions based on facial recognition 
techniques because it has been difficult for their users to type passwords to authenticate transactions in mobile devices with small screens and  
Master cards has adopted it in order to drastically cut-down the cost of false decilned transactions.

We identify two main contexts in which biometrics is being used for authentication as local authentication and remote authentication. In the 
first case, user is present at the authenticator's premise when authentication is performed and a device of the autheticator captures the 
biometrics. In the second case, authentication is performed over the network and the biometrics is captured by the user's device. Second case 
involves more challenges than the first one in terms of liveliness verification of the biometrics to avoid spoofing attacks and in terms of
guaranteeing the secure transmission of the biometrics. Furthermore, remote biometrics based authentication is being widely used as online-banking 
and e-commerce applications are increasingly adopting it as mentioned above.

Aforementioned commercial systems that are being deplyoed for authenticating users with biometrics today, inherit key security concerns 
irrespective of the fact that they incorporate state-of-the-art facial/voice recognition algorithms and liveliness checking techniques. First, user's 
biometrics templates are stored in the server databases for matching during the authentication, which become major targets 
of attackers.
For examples, in Google Hands Free system, user's picture taken at the authentication time is matched with the user's Hands Free profile picture and 
in Citi bank system, users pre-recorded voice samples are matched with their voices captured when they call in. Second, different 
third party service providers will be storing different biometrics traits of the user (such as face, voice and fingerprint) which together with 
linkability, make multiple points of vulnerability on one's biometrics identity. Third, each time the user remotely authenticates using biometrics, 
current protocols require the users to send a raw biometrics sample (e.g: a selfie in Amazon) over the network which is not desirable as such 
biometrics samples reveal sensitive features of the user's biometrics which are used to uniquely identify an individual. Stolen biometrics templates 
from server databases or from authentication channel lead to identity theft which poses severe threat to user's digital identity compared to the case 
when a password is stolen, because of the inherited non-revocable nature of the biometrics. We can not solely rely on 

The second issue mentioned above can be avoided by getting a trusted identity provider (IDP) to enroll user's biometrics identity as in the cases of 
Google Hands Free and IdentityX, however, if the IDP is involved in each transaction that the user authenticates, it undermines user privacy since 
the IDP gets to know about different transactions that the user performs with different service providers.
  
To address aforementioned security and privacy concerns, we envision a biometrics based remote authentication protocol which could be carried out 
from user's mobile devices with following characteristics:
\begin{enumerate}
 \item User's biometrics identity is enrolled with only a trusted IDP ().
 \item Biometrics is not stored anywhere i
\end{enumerate}


This can be avoided by having a trusted IDP doing the auth verification for you. E.g: Google's Hands Free pay. But then the problem is: IDP knows 
about every place you make purchases which undermines your privacy. While we encourage enrolling biometrics at one trusted party, we do not 
encourage that trusted party being involved in every transaction of the user.\\
- Need to protect the database.\\
- Need to reveal the biometrics each time. Higher risk of getting stolen.\\
- If compromised, higher risk than password.\\

Our goal is to develop a privacy preserving one - no storage of biometrics, no revealation of biometrics during auth, user-centric (no IDP involved 
after initial enrollment.) still the authenticator is confirmed that user is authenticated using his/her biometrics.\\
Unique, non-repeatable, non-revocable.\\
In in-person (Google pilot project for in-store profile picture for payment verification) and remote authentication (Amazon and Ali-play). More 
challenges in remore authentication compared to in-person.\\
\section{Past and on-going research work:}
ZKP. This has been used for static identity based authentication for a long time, since its first inception in 1986 - FFS. 
Fulfils all requirements except for one major challenge.
Challenge is using biometrics as the identity due to its non-static nature. We needed to develop a mechanism that creates repeatable, revocable and 
unique BID. We use ML methods as opposed to traditional distance matching (I need to do a benchmarking to prove that ML outperforms distance 
matching).

\subsubsection{Overview of the solution}
(from our paper)

Currently, we are implementing it in the mobile phone, to test its feasibility interms of performance and security.
Auth app is separate - which is trusted, which is invoked by any third party client app.
\section{Next research goal:}
In the previous approach, 
- depend upon trust of hardware of phone to protect artifacts stored on the phone. Apple touch ID and android fingerprint authn framework use that. 
But there has been attacks on trust zone uncovered in the past, which has been fixed. Although there is research going on that 
area as well, it is good to rely on them as less as possible, as the tech is not public for review.
- We argue that attack window is very small. But there are recent attacks to recover sensitive info. from physical memory images. Trust zone is just 
virtual world in same physical processor and therefore, should be vulnerable to this, although is not specifically tested by the researchers.

To address such concerns, GC is a good candidate. If we can encode ML model as a function, rather than a file (as we are currently using.)
There are GC techniques specialized on classification functions.

\section{Background and potential impact:}
- After the current work is over, at the end of this semester, we will have a working prototype of our past approach in the mobile phone. PhD student 
Hasini will be attending a summer school conducted by leaders of secure mpc and oblivious computation research to learn the current-state-of-the-art 
techniques. She has got a travel grant form NSF to participate in this.
- Google ATAP project has accepted a proposal written by us and has funded Purdue.
- Can help make existing biometrics based remote authentication in day-to-day transactions such as online-banking and e-commerce secure, which 
already has a large user base and increasing.\\
- Generalization of this techniques can have impact on other ML tasks where privacy is a concern.

Privacy Preserving Biometrics based Authentication Protocol for Mobile Devices}


\begin{document}
\maketitle
\section{Motivation:}
Biometrics has been used as a strong factor of authentication. \\
Unique, non-repeatable, non-revocable.\\
In in-person and remote authentication. More challenges in remore authentication compared to in-person.\\
Popular e-commerce applications moving towards this, for user friendliness and security. Although their FRT is improving, security wise their using 
traditional template matching. It has several risks:\\
- Several SPs maintaining it.\\
- Need to protect the database.\\
- If compromised, higher risk than password.\\
